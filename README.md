# ðŸŽ² Dice Roll Predictor AI

A simple machine learning-based dice roll predictor with a dark-themed GUI built using Python and Tkinter. The app simulates dice rolls, makes predictions using a trained Random Forest Classifier, and tracks accuracy over time. All roll history and predictions are logged and saved locally.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Roll a 6-sided die with one click  
- Predict the next dice roll using ML (trained on simulated data)  
- Dark mode GUI with clean layout  
- Logs all rolls, predictions, and correctness to a local JSON file  
- View full history in a scrollable popup window  
- Works fully offline

## ðŸ“š Educational Purpose

> ðŸŽ“ **Note:** Dice rolls are inherently random and cannot be truly predicted. This project isn't about beating probabilityâ€”it's about understanding how machine learning behaves in unpredictable environments.

This app is a hands-on tool for exploring:
- How machine learning models (like Random Forests) respond to randomness  
- Key concepts like **overfitting**, **false pattern recognition**, and **stochastic modeling**  
- Python GUI design using Tkinter  
- Local data logging with JSON  
- Real-time accuracy tracking in a visually engaging way  

Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or educator, this project serves as a fun, visual introduction to the **limits and quirks of ML algorithms** when applied to chaotic data.
