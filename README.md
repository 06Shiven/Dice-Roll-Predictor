ðŸŽ² Dice Roll Predictor AI
A simple machine learning-based dice roll predictor with a dark-themed GUI built using Python and Tkinter. The app simulates dice rolls, makes predictions using a trained Random Forest Classifier, and tracks prediction accuracy over time. All roll history and predictions are logged and saved locally.

ðŸ§  Features
Roll a 6-sided die with one click

Predict the next dice roll using ML (trained on simulated data)

Dark mode GUI with clean layout

Logs all rolls, predictions, and correctness to a local JSON file

View full history in a scrollable popup window

Works fully offline

ðŸ“š Educational Purpose
Disclaimer: Dice rolls are completely random and cannot be truly predicted with machine learning.

This project is not about beating randomnessâ€”it's about exploring machine learning behavior in unpredictable environments. Itâ€™s a fun, hands-on way to understand:

How machine learning models like Random Forests behave on random data

Concepts like overfitting, randomness, and false pattern detection

GUI creation using Python and Tkinter

Local data logging with JSON

Accuracy tracking over time

It's an ideal project for learning or teaching:

ML fundamentals

GUI programming

Probability and randomness

The limits of prediction algorithms

ðŸ¤” Why Build This?
Because not every ML project has to solve a real-world problem. This one is built to demonstrate, educate, and entertainâ€”itâ€™s a sandbox for understanding how algorithms handle randomness, with a clean GUI to make it engaging.
